Consider P1(a,c) and P2(b,d) to be two points on a 2D plane where (a,b) are the respective minimum and maximum values of Northern Latitude (LAT_N) and (c,d) are the respective minimum and maximum values of Western Longitude (LONG_W) in STATION.

Query the Euclidean Distance between points  and  and format your answer to display 4 decimal digits.

Input Format

The STATION table is described as follows:
FIELD
ID (NUMBER)
CITY (VARCHAR2(21))
STATE (VARCHAR2(2))
LAT_N (NUMBER)
LONG_W (NUMBER)

Answer:
select round(sqrt(power(abs(min(lat_n)-max(lat_n)),2)+power(abs(min(long_w)-max(long_w)),2)),4) from station
